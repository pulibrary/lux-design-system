<div class="spacing">
	<p>Principles are the foundation of the system. They form the basis of a good product and help the team with decision making. They are here to guide you and your team when working with the myriad parts of the system and help you do better and make more informed decisions.</p>
</div>


<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###1. We start with user needs.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Do research, analyze data, talk to users. Don't make assumptions. Be human. Define the problem first.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###2. We add more value by presenting fewer choices.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Less is more. We seek to reduce clutter and cognitive load. Every piece of functionality we add to the system should add value for our users.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###3. We are consistent.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We are consistent with our designs, the language we use on interfaces, our code, and our data.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###4. We design with data.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We embrace data-driven decision making. We measure and evaluate against the original goals.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###5. We use our user's language.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Words can both clarify and confuse. We seek to use language that is familiar to our users and avoid using jargon.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###6. We make it accessible, responsive, and inclusive.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Everything we build is WCAG 2.0 AA compliant. We sacrifice elegance to inclusiveness, readability, and legibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###7. We provide context.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>By communicating how everything interrelates, people are much more likely to understand the importance of what they are looking at.</p>
    <p>The design should keep people aware of where they are within the overall experience at all times in a consistent and clear fashion.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###8. We collaborate.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We tackle problems together. We listen, we understand, we critique, and we encourage rather than force solutions. We learn from each other and understand the value of what we're building.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###9. We make it shareable and reusable.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If we have found a way of doing something that works, we share it whenever we can instead of reinventing the wheel every time.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h3>###10. We test and iterate.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We are aware that our solutions are assumptions unless tested with real users.</p>
    <p>We test hypotheses, learn, and improve our ideas.</p>
</div>
