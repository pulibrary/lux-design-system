The process of adding an icon involves splitting the SVG markup of the iconset that we use, to create individual icon components that are dynamically filled, sized, and labeled.

## Where can I get icons?

Iconsets are currently located in a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7lJwwFLye5XaTNzdFAwRTEyNlk). We use the Ultimate Developer Filled and Line iconsets. You can preview [Streamline Filled](https://web.archive.org/web/20180112173120/http://www.streamlineicons.com:80/preview-ultimate-filled.html) and [Streamline Line](https://web.archive.org/web/20180116032529/http://www.streamlineicons.com:80/preview-ultimate.html) sets.

## How do I add icons to our PUL iconset?

_Note: Try to add icons from the Streamline iconset so that our icons have a consistent look and feel. If creating new icons, please attempt to make it look as if it is part of the same iconset._

_Note: We recommend importing this directory (and any other sets) into [IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/) for local font browsing and management. There's a free 14-day trial. If you suspect you will need to add more items in the future, talk to your manager about obtaining a license._

1.  Download the `Streamline Source Files/Iconjar.zip` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7lJwwFLye5XYUVxRVpsQndRWFU). Unzip the Iconjar.zip file.
2.  Open [IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/).
3.  Click "Import IconJar" from the File menu at the top of the screen.
4.  Choose line or filled and import separately.
5.  Right-click on desired icon and select "Show in Finder".
6.  Make a duplicate of one of the LUX icon components (e.g., LuxIconFile.vue) and rename it appropriately.
7.  Open the SVG file in your IDE.
8.  Copy all markup between the `<svg>` tag and paste it in between the `<template>` tags in the .vue file. If there are multiple elements, wrap them in a `<g>` tag.
9.  Save your new component, and make sure to wrap it in `<lux-icon-base>` with an appropriate `icon-name` attribute when you use it.

### Example usage:

```jsx
<lux-icon-base width="30" height="30" icon-name="file">
  <lux-icon-file />
</lux-icon-base>
```
